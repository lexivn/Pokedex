#Pokédex Application
The Pokédex application displays a list of Pokémon and allows the user to view details for each of them. Don’t worry if you’re not a big fan of Pokémon — You’ll be able to apply what you've learned to any sort of app with similar functionality, such as an animal database, cocktail recipe app, or digital joke book. While the UI would, no doubt, differ greatly depending on the subject matter, the data model in the background would be similar regardless of content.

In general this type this application will **display** a list of data items, allowing the user to get a detailed view of each individual item on the list. This is a very common use case for applications.
